                    Explosion of Mass-Losing Helium Stars</a><br> In a
                    series of four papers our group has explored the
                    evolution of stars in sufficiently tight binaries
                    that the hydrogen envelope is lost at the onset of
                    helium burning. Subsequent mass loss by winds is
                    included. The results resemble those of single
                    stars except that presupernova core mass for a
                    given main sequence mass is appreciably
                    smaller. Our model stars are exploded using a
                    one-dimensional treatment of neutrino-transport
                    calibrated to SN 1987A and the Crab. Explosion
                    energies, nucleosynthesis, and remnant properties
                    are thus sensitive to presupernova structure. The
                    mass distributions for neutron stars and black
                    holes are in good agreement with measured
                    properties. No black hole mass gap is found at low
                    masses, though there is a reduced probability
                    below 5 solar masses. Our predictions will be
                    useful to LIGO and show the possibility of
                    measuring the stellar IMF for high mass stars.
                    The light curves of the Type Ib and Ic supernovae
                    these explosions produce have been simulated in
                    the KEPLER and SEDONA codes.Most have presupernova
                    masses between 2.7 and 5.6 solar masses.  No
                    explosion produces a $^{56}$Ni mass greater than
                    0.15 solar masses, a bolometric luminosity over
                    10**(42.5) erg/s, or a visual magnitude brighter
                    than -18.0. These limits agree with many but not
                    all observations of Ib and Ic supernovae
                    suggesting that many allegedly normal Type Ib and
                    Ic supernovae may not be illuminated at peak by
                    radioactive decay.

                  Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and their
                  progenitors are some of the most astrophysically
                  interesting objects in the universe. We have done a
                  multidimensional study of the late stage stellar
                  evolution, silicon shell burning (SiSB), that
                  directly proceeds core-collapse of a 15 M⊙
                  star. SiSB is highly convective and creates
                  asymmetries in CCSNe progenitors that affect stellar
                  structure, nucleosynthesis, and the growth and
                  collapse of the iron core. We have simulated a 15 M⊙
                  star from stellar birth to SiSB in 1D, using Modules
                  for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) and
                  SiSB to Iron core collapse in 1D and 2D using the
                  MESA progenitor and the Polaris code.

                  We develop a highly efficient high order method for
                  the Gray equation of transport in 5D.  The basic
                  method is based on a split step approach, where the
                  model is split into a collided and un-collided
                  species.  The steps of the method are to: (1) solve
                  the un-collided species with fast sweeping, (2) move
                  the particles the collided from the un-collided
                  species into the collided species, (3) use a fully
                  implicit update to solve the collided species.  At
                  the end of the step, the collided species are
                  re-promoted into the un-collided species.  The
                  discretization is based on Discontinuous Galerkin.
                  Efficiency gains are made by using a low number of
                  quadrature angles for the collided species and a
                  full set of quadrature angles for the un-collided
                  species.  A conservative map that ensures positivity
                  based Nystrom reconstruction is used to move between
                  the two resolutions.  The base idea is that using a
                  low number of quadrature angles in the collided
                  model is sufficient for capturing highly collisional
                  regions, and that using a full set of quadrature
                  angles in the un-collided model will capture the
                  free streaming regions.  The whole algorithm is
                  rapped in a "space time" Integral Differed
                  Correction framework that corrects for the errors
                  made in both splitting and in the errors introduced
                  by using a low number of angles quadrature angles in
                  the fully implicit collided update.  The method is
                  the first splitting algorithm of this type to be
                  able to correctly described the transition from a
                  highly collisional region to a free streaming region
                  while maintaining high order in space and time.  In
                  tests we show that the method is two orders of
                  magnitude faster than the fully resolved high order
                  method with the same computational accuracy.  This
                  method will serve as the basses for our new work we
                  are developing on using ML for closure models in M1
                  transport.  We will briefly outline our planned work
                  in this area.

                  Supernovae, massive stellar interiors, and neutron
                  star mergers are fundamentally turbulent,
                  magnetohydrodynamic systems. As such, accurately
                  simulating these phenomena requires numerical
                  solvers that are capable of capturing both the
                  impact of magnetic fields and the
                  difficult-to-resolve turbulence. High-order accurate
                  MHD solvers present attractive features for tackling
                  these types of problems. I will discuss our efforts
                  to implement high-order MHD solvers in FLASH using
                  both finite volume and finite difference
                  formulations. I will discuss initial performance and
                  relative strengths and weaknesses of each method for
                  addressing astrophysical simulations.

                <td>Neutrino Transport and Nucleosynthesis in Collapsar Disks<br>

                  When a very massive, rapidly rotating star runs out
                  of nuclear fuel and undergoes core-collapse, a black
                  hole-accretion disk system may form. In these
                  so-called "failed supernovae," accretion onto the
                  rotating black hole can power a jet of relativistic
                  material out the poles. If this jet is sufficiently
                  powerful to disrupt the in-falling stellar envelope,
                  the system explodes as a "jet-driven supernova" or
                  "collapsar." We discuss the recently revived
                  suggestion that collapsars are a major source of the
                  fusion of heavy elements in the universe. We perform
                  general relativistic neutrino radiation
                  magnetohydrodynamics simulations of collapsar disks
                  and extract nucleosynthetic yields. We show how
                  accurate treatment of neutrino transport in the disk
                  transport and the inclusion in-falling stellar
                  material is required to accurately capture the
                  dynamics. We find that very few heavy elements are
                  produced, providing counter-evidence to the
                  aforementioned suggestion.

                  I will present observational insight into

                  detailed three-dimensional core-collapse supernovae
                  simulations spanning a broad suite of progenitor
                  masses. Generally, such events are observables for
                  galactic events with current and next-generation
                  detectors. Simultaneous detection of both will
                  explore the large- and small-scale physical motions
                  of the exploder, provide insight into the physics of
                  the forming neutrino star, and illuminate the
                  mechanism of explosion. Additionally, we provide
                  some of the first estimates of gravitational
                  waveforms from neutrino asymmetries in addition to
                  matter motions. Synergistic detection of
                  gravitational waves and neutrinos will provide
                  physical information about supernovae evolution

                  nature via the rapid neutron capture (r) process of
                  nucleosynthesis. In sufficiently neutron-rich
                  r-process conditions, nuclear fission processes can
                  become extremely active. As such, robust theoretical
                  predictions of fission product yields represent one

                  understanding the astrophysical production of the
                  heaviest elements. We present a new technique for
                  quantitatively following fission products throughout
                  r-process nucleosynthesis calculations, and we apply
                  this technique in order to identify the relative
                  contributions of individual fission product yields
                  to overall r-process nucleosynthesis.

                <td>Sapsan: Framework for Supernovae Turbulence Modeling with Machine Learning<br>

                  Turbulence plays a significant role in many
                  different phenomena, including Core-Collapse
                  Supernovae (CCSN). Unfortunately, current
                  state-of-the-art simulations have to resort to using
                  subgrid models for turbulence treatment, as direct
                  numerical simulations (DNS) are too expensive to
                  run. However, said subgrid models, such as large
                  eddy simulation (LES), lack accuracy when compared
                  to DNS results. Recently, there has been a new trend
                  of utilizing Machine Learning (ML) techniques, with
                  impressive prediction capability for the turbulence
                  closure. That being said, the domain science field
                  in question lacks the expertise to employ ML for
                  their respective projects, not to say for turbulence
                  treatment. We have developed Sapsan, a pipeline
                  designed to simplify ML implementation, focusing on
                  physics-informed machine learning and analytical
                  tools to aid our team and researchers in general to
                  study turbulence in supernovae and other
                  astrophysical environments. Sapsan incorporates data
                  pre-processing, model construction, experiment
                  tracking, GUI & CLI interfaces, and can be used to
                  facilitate a variety of scientific machine learning

                  Because of the variety of physics involved in proper
                  numerical models of core collapse supernovae
                  (CCSNe), they stand as one of the main scientific
                  drivers for improving HPC resources.  Motivated by
                  the need to provide reliable gravitational wave
                  predictions for the next Galactic CCSNe, I will
                  review the newest piece of physics within the FLASH
                  framework—relativistic MHD.  Likewise I will outline
                  the future developments for FLASH with respect to
                  physics and performance portability.
